During the workshop we will use the Azure "Cloud Shell" console.   
All the tools required to run the lab are included.  
Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive, authenticated, browser-accessible shell for managing Azure resources.   
It provides the flexibility of choosing the shell experience that best suits the way you work, either Bash or PowerShell.  
Cloud Shell enables access to a browser-based command-line experience built with Azure management tasks in mind.  
Leverage Cloud Shell to work untethered from a local machine in a way only the cloud can provide.
